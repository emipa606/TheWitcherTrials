Updated for RimWorld 1.1 and Harmony 2.0

This mod allows you to research the ancient Witcher trials and perform the procedures on your pawns. 

You are able to research:
* The Trial of the Grasses: The first trial. The body is manipulated with herbs, toxins and poisons. This primarily affects the nervous system.
* The Trial of the Dreams: The second trial. The mutation of the eyes, hormones and bone marrow is performed.
* The Trial of the Elders: The final trial. Forgotton practices were once performed on the witchers. You too can uncover these secrets, and pay the price.
* The Witcher art of Metalurgy Create Steel swords, folded using witcher techniques. Heavier and harder than any other steel. Create Silver Swords, hardened with runes and witcher oils. Lighter and sharper than any other sword.
