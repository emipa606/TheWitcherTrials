(Please save your game FIRST. These operations unbalance vanilla pawns, and [spoiler]failed Trails of the Grasses[/spoiler] may kill your pawns.)

# Update v2.0:

v2.0 - [spoiler]C# implemented, Operations are sequential and require ingredients, white hair, witcher swords, and more.[/spoiler]


# Introduction
	
This mod allows you to research the ancient Witcher trials and perform the procedures on your pawns. You are able to research:

-  The Trial of the Grasses: The first trial. The body is manipulated with herbs, toxins and poisons. This primarily affects the nervous system.
-  The Trial of the Dreams: The second trial. The mutation of the eyes, hormones and bone marrow is performed.
-  The Trial of the Elders: The final trial. Forgotton practices were once performed on the witchers. You too can uncover these secrets, and pay the price.



# Good questions so far:


- I have a big modlist, are there any compatability issues? - I sincerely doubt it, my mod only adds.
- Can I use this on a running savegame? - Knock yourself out, will be fine. Uninstalling is a different matter. 
- When I apply a new Trial, the old one disappears? - This is expected behaviour. Its easier to calculate the balance of the mod when only one Trial is being applied to the stats.



# Anticipated questions:


- Q: My hair isnt white?! - 
	A: [spoiler]Keep going.[/spoiler]
- Q: These ingredients are unrealistic!/The research takes too long!/The costs are too damn high!
	A: [spoiler]Honestly? Witchers are overpowered, think of witchers as implanting every bionic. Now do you get it?[/spoiler]



# UNINSTALLING THIS MOD:
[olist]
-  Enable Dev Mode. (BUT I PERMANENTLY DISABLED IT!? - you've just learnt a valuable lesson.)
-  Use 'Destroy' to delete any items made by my mod.
-  Use 'Remove Hediff...' to disable the Trials bonuses on your affect pawns.
-  Save your game, exit rimworld.[/olist]
Your save should now be clean.


Feedback encouraged.
